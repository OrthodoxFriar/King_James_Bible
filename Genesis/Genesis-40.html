      <p>{40:23} Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 41</h4>
      <p>{41:1} And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</p>
      <p>{41:2} And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</p>
      <p>{41:3} And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the [other] kine upon the brink of the river.</p>
      <p>{41:4} And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</p>
      <p>{41:5} And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</p>
      <p>{41:6} And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</p>
      <p>{41:7} And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream.</p>
      <p>{41:8} And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>{41:9} Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</p>
      <p>{41:10} Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both [me] and the chief baker:</p>
      <p>{41:11} And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</p>
      <p>{41:12} And [there was] there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</p>
      <p>{41:13} And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>
      <p>{41:14} Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself,] and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>{41:15} And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, [that] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</p>
      <p>{41:16} And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</p>
      <p>{41:17} And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</p>
      <p>{41:18} And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</p>
      <p>{41:19} And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</p>
      <p>{41:20} And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</p>
      <p>{41:21} And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</p>
      <p>{41:22} And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</p>
      <p>{41:23} And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:</p>
