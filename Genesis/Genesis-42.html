      <h4>Genesis 42</h4>
      <p>42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?</p>
      <p>42:2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.</p>
      <p>42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.</p>
      <p>42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.</p>
      <p>42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy <i>corn</i> among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>42:6 And Joseph <i>was</i> the governor over the land, <i>and</i> he <i>it was</i> that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him <i>with</i> their faces to the earth.</p>
      <p>42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</p>
      <p>42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</p>
      <p>42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</p>
      <p>42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.</p>
      <p>42:1 1 We <i>are</i> all one man's sons; we <i>are</i> true <i>men,</i> thy servants are no spies.</p>
      <p>42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</p>
      <p>42:13 And they said, Thy servants <i>are</i> twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest <i>is</i> this day with our father, and one <i>is</i> not.</p>
      <p>42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That <i>is it</i> that I spake unto you, saying, Ye <i>are</i> spies:</p>
      <p>42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.</p>
      <p>42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether <i>there be any</i> truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye <i>are</i> spies.</p>
      <p>42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.</p>
      <p>42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; <i>for</i> I fear God:</p>
      <p>42:19 If ye <i>be</i> true <i>men,</i> let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:</p>
      <p>42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</p>
      <p>42:21 And they said one to another, We <i>are</i> verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</p>
      <p>42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</p>
      <p>42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood <i>them;</i> for he spake unto them by an interpreter.</p>
      <p>42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</p>
      <p>42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</p>
      <p>42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</p>
      <p>42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it <i>was</i> in his sack's mouth.</p>
      <p>42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, <i>it is</i> even in my sack: and their heart failed <i>them,</i> and they were afraid, saying one to another, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> God hath done unto us?</p>
      <p>42:29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,</p>
      <p>42:30 The man, <i>who is</i> the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.</p>
      <p>42:31 And we said unto him, We <i>are</i> true <i>men;</i> we are no spies:</p>
      <p>42:32 We <i>be</i> twelve brethren, sons of our father; one <i>is</i> not, and the youngest <i>is</i> this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye <i>are</i> true <i>men;</i> leave one of your brethren <i>here</i> with me, and take <i>food for</i> the famine of your households, and be gone:</p>
      <p>42:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye <i>are</i> no spies, but <i>that</i> ye <i>are</i> true <i>men: so</i> will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</p>
      <p>42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money <i>was</i> in his sack: and when <i>both</i> they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</p>
      <p>42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved <i>of my children:</i> Joseph <i>is</i> not, and Simeon <i>is</i> not, and ye will take Benjamin <i>away:</i> all these things are against me.</p>
      <p>42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</p>
      <p>42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
