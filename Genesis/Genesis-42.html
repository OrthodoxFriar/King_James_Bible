      <p>{42:25} Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</p>
      <p>{42:26} And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</p>
      <p>{42:27} And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it [was] in his sack's mouth.</p>
      <p>{42:28} And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them,] and they were afraid, saying one to another, What [is] this [that] God hath done unto us?</p>
      <p>{42:29} And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,</p>
      <p>{42:30} The man, [who is] the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.</p>
      <p>{42:31} And we said unto him, We [are] true [men;] we are no spies:</p>
      <p>{42:32} We [be] twelve brethren, sons of our father; one [is] not, and the youngest [is] this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>{42:33} And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye [are] true [men;] leave one of your brethren [here] with me, and take [food for] the famine of your households, and be gone:</p>
      <p>{42:34} And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye [are] no spies, but [that] ye [are] true [men: so] will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</p>
      <p>{42:35} And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money [was] in his sack: and when [both] they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</p>
      <p>{42:36} And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved [of my children:] Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will take Benjamin [away:] all these things are against me.</p>
      <p>{42:37} And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</p>
      <p>{42:38} And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 43</h4>
      <p>{43:1} And the famine [was] sore in the land.</p>
      <p>{43:2} And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</p>
      <p>{43:3} And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother [be] with you.</p>
      <p>{43:4} If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:</p>
      <p>{43:5} But if thou wilt not send [him,] we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother [be] with you.</p>
      <p>{43:6} And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?</p>
      <p>{43:7} And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, [Is] your father yet alive? have ye [another] brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</p>
      <p>{43:8} And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, [and] also our little ones.</p>
      <p>{43:9} I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:</p>
      <p>{43:10} For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</p>
      <p>{43:11} And their father Israel said unto them, If [it must be] so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</p>
      <p>{43:12} And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry [it] again in your hand; peradventure it [was] an oversight:</p>
      <p>{43:13} Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</p>
      <p>{43:14} And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved [of my children,] I am bereaved.</p>
      <p>{43:15} And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
      <p>{43:16} And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring [these] men home, and slay, and make ready; for [these] men shall dine with me at noon.</p>
      <p>{43:17} And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.</p>
      <p>{43:18} And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</p>
      <p>{43:19} And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</p>
      <p>{43:20} And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</p>
      <p>{43:21} And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, [every] man's money [was] in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</p>
      <p>{43:22} And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</p>
      <p>{43:23} And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</p>
      <p>{43:24} And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave [them] water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</p>
      <p>{43:25} And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
