         <p>{22:4} Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</p>
         <p>{22:5} And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you,</p>
         <p>{22:6} And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid [it] upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.</p>
         <p>{22:7} And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here [am] I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where [is] the lamb for a burnt offering?</p>
         <p>{22:8} And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</p>
         <p>{22:9} And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</p>
         <p>{22:10} And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</p>
         <p>{22:11} And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here [am] I.</p>
         <p>{22:12} And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son] from me.</p>
         <p>{22:13} And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind [him] a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.</p>
         <p>{22:14} And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said [to] this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.</p>
         <p>{22:15} And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,</p>
         <p>{22:16} And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son: ]</p>
         <p>{22:17} That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which [is] upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</p>
         <p>{22:18} And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>
         <p>{22:19} So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</p>
         <p>{22:20} And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;</p>
         <p>{22:21} Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,</p>
         <p>{22:22} And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</p>
         <p>{22:23} And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.</p>
         <p>{22:24} And his concubine, whose name [was] Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.</p> 
      <h4>Genesis 23</h4>
      <p>{23:1} And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: [these were] the years of the life of Sarah.</p>
      <p>{23:2} And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same [is] Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</p>
      <p>{23:3} And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,</p>
      <p>{23:4} I [am] a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</p>
