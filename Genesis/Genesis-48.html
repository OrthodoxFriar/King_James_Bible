      <p>{49:9} Judah [is] a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</p>
      <p>{49:10} The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him [shall] the gathering of the people [be. ]</p>
      <p>{49: 11} Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</p>
      <p>{49:12} His eyes [shall be] red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</p>
      <p>{49:13} Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he [shall be] for an haven of ships; and his border [shall be] unto Zidon.</p>
      <p>{49:14} Issachar [is] a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</p>
      <p>{49:15} And he saw that rest [was] good, and the land that [it was] pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</p>
      <p>{49:16} Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
      <p>{49:17} Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>
      <p>{49:18} I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</p>
      <p>{49:19} Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</p>
      <p>{49:20} Out of Asher his bread [shall be] fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</p>
      <p>{49:21} Naphtali [is] a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</p>
      <p>{49:22} Joseph [is] a fruitful bough, [even] a fruitful bough by a well; [whose] branches run over the wall:</p>
      <p>{49:23} The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot [at him,] and hated him:</p>
      <p>{49:24} But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty [God] of Jacob; (from thence [is] the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</p>
      <p>{49:25} [Even] by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</p>
      <p>{49:26} The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</p>
      <p>{49:27} Benjamin shall ravin [as] a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</p>
      <p>{49:28} All these [are] the twelve tribes of Israel: and this [is it] that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</p>
      <p>{49:29} And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that [is] in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</p>
      <p>{49:30} In the cave that [is] in the field of Machpelah, which [is] before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</p>
      <p>{49:31} There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</p>
