      <p>{33:15} And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee [some] of the folk that [are] with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</p>
      <p>{33:16} So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</p>
      <p>{33:17} And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</p>
      <p>{33:18} And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan- aram; and pitched his tent before the city.</p>
      <p>{33:19} And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem' s father, for an hundred pieces of money.</p>
      <p>{33:20} And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 34</h4>
      <p>{34: 1} And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.</p>
      <p>{34:2} And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.</p>
      <p>{34:3} And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.</p>
      <p>{34:4} And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.</p>
      <p>{34:5} And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.</p>
      <p>{34:6} And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.</p>
      <p>{34:7} And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard [it:] and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.</p>
      <p>{34:8} And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.</p>
      <p>{34:9} And make ye marriages with us, [and] give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.</p>
      <p>{34:10} And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.</p>
      <p>{34:11} And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.</p>
      <p>{34:12} Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.</p>
      <p>{34:13} And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:</p>
      <p>{34:14} And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that [were] a reproach unto us:</p>
      <p>{34:15} But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we [be,] that every male of you be circumcised;</p>
