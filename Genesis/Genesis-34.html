      <p>{34:16} Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.</p>
      <p>{34:17} But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.</p>
      <p>{34:18} And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.</p>
      <p>{34:19} And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he [was] more honourable than all the house of his father.</p>
      <p>{34:20} And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,</p>
      <p>{34:21} These men [are] peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, [it is] large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.</p>
      <p>{34:22} Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they [are] circumcised.</p>
      <p>{34:23} [Shall] not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs [be] ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.</p>
      <p>{34:24} And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.</p>
      <p>{34:25} And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.</p>
      <p>{34:26} And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem' s house, and went out.</p>
      <p>{34:27} The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.</p>
      <p>{34:28} They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which [was] in the city, and that which [was] in the field,</p>
      <p>{34:29} And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that [was] in the house.</p>
      <p>{34:30} And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I [being] few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</p>
      <p>{34:31} And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?</p>
      <h4>Genesis 35</h4>
      <p>{35:1} And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</p>
      <p>{35:2} Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that [were] with him, Put away the strange gods that [are] among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</p>
      <p>{35:3} And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</p>
      <p>{35:4} And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their] earrings which [were] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem.</p>
      <p>{35:5} And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that [were] round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</p>
      <p>{35:6} So Jacob came to Luz, which [is] in the land of Canaan, that [is,] Bethel, he and all the people that [were] with him.</p>
      <p>{35:7} And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</p>
      <p>{35:8} But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon- bachuth.</p>
      <p>{35:9} And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.</p>
      <p>{35:10} And God said unto him, Thy name [is] Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</p>
      <p>{35:11} And God said unto him, I [am] God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</p>
      <p>{35:12} And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p>
      <p>{35:13} And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</p>
      <p>{35:14} And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, [even] a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</p>
      <p>{35:15} And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.</p>
      <p>{35:16} And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</p>
