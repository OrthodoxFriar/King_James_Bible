      <p>{43:26} And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which [was] in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</p>
      <p>{43:27} And he asked them of [their] welfare, and said, [Is] your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? [Is] he yet alive?</p>
      <p>{43:28} And they answered, Thy servant our father [is] in good health, he [is] yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</p>
      <p>{43:29} And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, [Is] this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</p>
      <p>{43:30} And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought [where] to weep; and he entered into [his] chamber, and wept there.</p>
      <p>{43:31} And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</p>
      <p>{43:32} And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that [is] an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>{43:33} And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</p>
      <p>{43:34} And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 44</h4>
      <p>{44:1} And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks [with] food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.</p>
      <p>{44:2} And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</p>
      <p>{44:3} As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</p>
      <p>{44:4} [And] when they were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</p>
      <p>{44:5} [Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</p>
      <p>{44:6} And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</p>
      <p>{44:7} And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:</p>
      <p>{44:8} Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</p>
      <p>{44:9} With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</p>
      <p>{44:10} And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</p>
      <p>{44:11} Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</p>
      <p>{44:12} And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</p>
      <p>{44:13} Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>
      <p>{44:14} And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he [was] yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</p>
      <p>{44:15} And Joseph said unto them, What deed [is] this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</p>
      <p>{44:16} And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we, and [he] also with whom the cup is found.</p>
      <p>{44:17} And he said, God forbid that I should do so: [but] the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</p>
      <p>{44:18} Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou [art] even as Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>{44:19} My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</p>
      <p>{44:20} And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</p>
      <p>{44:21} And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</p>
      <p>{44:22} And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for [if] he should leave his father, [his father] would die.</p>
      <p>{44:23} And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</p>
      <p>{44:24} And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</p>
      <p>{44:25} And our father said, Go again, [and] buy us a little food.</p>
      <p>{44:26} And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother [be] with us.</p>
