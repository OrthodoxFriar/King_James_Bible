      <h4>Genesis 43</h4>
      <p>43:1 And the famine <i>was</i> sore in the land.</p>
      <p>43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</p>
      <p>43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i>be</i> with you.</p>
      <p>43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:</p>
      <p>43:5 But if thou wilt not send <i>him,</i> we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i>be</i> with you.</p>
      <p>43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?</p>
      <p>43:7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, <i>Is</i> your father yet alive? have ye <i>another</i> brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</p>
      <p>43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, <i>and</i> also our little ones.</p>
      <p>43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:</p>
      <p>43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</p>
      <p>43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If <i>it must be</i> so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</p>
      <p>43:12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry <i>it</i> again in your hand; peradventure it <i>was</i> an oversight:</p>
      <p>43:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</p>
      <p>43:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved <i>of my children,</i> I am bereaved.</p>
      <p>43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
      <p>43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring <i>these</i> men home, and slay, and make ready; for <i>these</i> men shall dine with me at noon.</p>
      <p>43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.</p>
      <p>43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</p>
      <p>43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</p>
      <p>43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</p>
      <p>43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, <i>every</i> man's money <i>was</i> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</p>
      <p>43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</p>
      <p>43:23 And he said, Peace <i>be</i> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</p>
      <p>43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave <i>them</i> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</p>
      <p>43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
      <p>43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which <i>was</i> in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</p>
      <p>43:27 And he asked them of <i>their</i> welfare, and said, <i>Is</i> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? <i>Is</i> he yet alive?</p>
      <p>43:28 And they answered, Thy servant our father <i>is</i> in good health, he <i>is</i> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</p>
      <p>43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, <i>Is</i> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</p>
      <p>43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought <i>where</i> to weep; and he entered into <i>his</i> chamber, and wept there.</p>
      <p>43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</p>
      <p>43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that <i>is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</p>
      <p>43:34 And he took <i>and sent</i> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>
