         <h4>Genesis 9</h4>
         <p>9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</p>
         <p>9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth <i>upon</i> the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.</p>
         <p>9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.</p>
         <p>9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, <i>which is</i> the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.</p>
         <p>9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.</p>
         <p>9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</p>
         <p>9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.</p>
         <p>9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</p>
         <p>9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;</p>
         <p>9:10 And with every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.</p>
         <p>9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>
         <p>9:12 And God said, This <i>is</i> the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, for perpetual generations:</p>
         <p>9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</p>
         <p>9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:</p>
         <p>9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which <i>is</i> between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</p>
         <p>9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <i>is</i> upon the earth.</p>
         <p>9:17 And God said unto Noah, This <i>is</i> the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that <i>is</i> upon the earth.</p>
         <p>9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.</p>
         <p>9:19 These <i>are</i> the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.</p>
         <p>9:20 And Noah began <i>to be</i> an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:</p>
         <p>9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.</p>
         <p>9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.</p>
         <p>9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid <i>it</i> upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces <i>were</i> backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.</p>
         <p>9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.</p>
         <p>9:25 And he said, Cursed <i>be</i> Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</p>
         <p>9:26 And he said, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>
         <p>9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>
         <p>9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</p>
         <p>9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</p>
