         <p>{9:2} And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth [upon] the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.</p>
         <p>{9:3} Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.</p>
         <p>{9:4} But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.</p>
         <p>{9:5} And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.</p>
         <p>{9:6} Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</p>
         <p>{9:7} And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.</p>
         <p>{9:8} And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</p>
         <p>{9:9} And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;</p>
         <p>{9:10} And with every living creature that [is] with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.</p>
         <p>{9:11} And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>
         <p>{9:12} And God said, This [is] the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that [is] with you, for perpetual generations:</p>
         <p>{9:13} I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</p>
         <p>{9:14} And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:</p>
         <p>{9:15} And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</p>
         <p>{9:16} And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that [is] upon the earth.</p>
         <p>{9:17} And God said unto Noah, This [is] the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that [is] upon the earth.</p>
         <p>{9:18} And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.</p>
         <p>{9:19} These [are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.</p>
         <p>{9:20} And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:</p>
         <p>{9:21} And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.</p>
         <p>{9:22} And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.</p>
         <p>{9:23} And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.</p>
         <p>{9:24} And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.</p>
         <p>{9:25} And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</p>
         <p>{9:26} And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>
         <p>{9:27} God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>
         <p>{9:28} And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</p>
         <p>{9:29} And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</p>
         <h4>Genesis 10</h4>
         <p>{10:1} Now these [are] the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</p>
         <p>{10:2} The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</p>
