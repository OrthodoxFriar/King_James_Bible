      <p>{35:17} And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</p>
      <p>{35:18} And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.</p>
      <p>{35:19} And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which [is] Bethlehem.</p>
      <p>{35:20} And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that [is] the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.</p>
      <p>{35:21} And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</p>
      <p>{35:22} And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard [it.] Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</p>
      <p>{35:23} The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</p>
      <p>{35:24} The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>
      <p>{35:25} And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:</p>
      <p>{35:26} And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these [are] the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.</p>
      <p>{35:27} And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which [is] Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</p>
      <p>{35:28} And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</p>
      <p>{35:29} And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, [being] old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 36</h4>
      <p>{36:1} Now these [are] the generations of Esau, who [is] Edom.</p>
      <p>{36:2} Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;</p>
      <p>{36:3} And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.</p>
      <p>{36:4} And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;</p>
      <p>{36:5} And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these [are] the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>{36:6} And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.</p>
      <p>{36:7} For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.</p>
      <p>{36:8} Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau [is] Edom.</p>
      <p>{36:9} And these [are] the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:</p>
      <p>{36:10} These [are] the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.</p>
      <p>{36:11} And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.</p>
      <p>{36:12} And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these [were] the sons of Adah Esau's wife.</p>
      <p>{36:13} And these [are] the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.</p>
      <p>{36:14} And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.</p>
      <p>{36:15} These [were] dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn [son] of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,</p>
      <p>{36:16} Duke Korah, duke Gatam, [and] duke Amalek: these [are] the dukes [that came] of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these [were] the sons of Adah.</p>
      <p>{36:17} And these [are] the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these [are] the dukes [that came] of Reuel in the land of Edom; these [are] the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.</p>
