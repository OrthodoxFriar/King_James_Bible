      <p>{37:19} And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</p>
      <p>{37:20} Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</p>
      <p>{37:21} And Reuben heard [it,] and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.</p>
      <p>{37:22} And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, [but] cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</p>
      <p>{37:23} And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, [his] coat of [many] colours that [was] on him;</p>
      <p>{37:24} And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit [was] empty, [there was] no water in it.</p>
      <p>{37:25} And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry [it] down to Egypt.</p>
      <p>{37:26} And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit [is it] if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</p>
      <p>{37:27} Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he [is] our brother [and] our flesh. And his brethren were content.</p>
      <p>{37:28} Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty [pieces] of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</p>
      <p>{37:29} And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph [was] not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</p>
      <p>{37:30} And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child [is] not; and I, whither shall I go?</p>
      <p>{37:31} And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;</p>
      <p>{37:32} And they sent the coat of [many] colours, and they brought [it] to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it [be] thy son's coat or no.</p>
      <p>{37:33} And he knew it, and said, [It is] my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</p>
      <p>{37:34} And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</p>
      <p>{37:35} And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</p>
      <p>{37:36} And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, [and] captain of the guard.</p>
      <p>{38:1} And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name [was] Hirah.</p>
      <p>{38:2} And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name [was] Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</p>
      <p>{38:3} And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.</p>
      <p>{38:4} And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.</p>
      <p>{38:5} And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.</p>
      <p>{38:6} And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name [was] Tamar.</p>
      <p>{38:7} And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.</p>
      <p>{38:8} And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</p>
      <p>{38:9} And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled [it] on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.</p>
      <p>{38:10} And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.</p>
      <p>{38:11} Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren [did.] And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</p>
      <p>{38:12} And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</p>
      <p>{38:13} And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</p>
      <p>{38:14} And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which [is] by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</p>
      <p>{38:15} When Judah saw her, he thought her [to be] an harlot; because she had covered her face.</p>
      <p>{38:16} And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she [was] his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</p>
      <p>{38:17} And he said, I will send [thee] a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, till thou send [it? ]</p>
      <p>{38:18} And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that [is] in thine hand. And he gave [it] her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</p>
      <p>{38:19} And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>
      <p>{38:20} And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive [his] pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.</p>
