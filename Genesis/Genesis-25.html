      <p>{25:7} And these [are] the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</p>
      <p>{25:8} Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full [of years;] and was gathered to his people.</p>
      <p>{25:9} And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] before Mamre;</p>
      <p>{25:10} The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>
      <p>{25:11} And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.</p>
      <p>{25:12} Now these [are] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</p>
      <p>{25:13} And these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p>
      <p>{25:14} And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p>
      <p>{25:15} Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</p>
      <p>{25:16} These [are] the sons of Ishmael, and these [are] their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</p>
      <p>{25:17} And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</p>
      <p>{25:18} And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that [is] before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: [and] he died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
      <p>{25:19} And these [are] the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:</p>
      <p>{25:20} And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</p>
      <p>{25:21} And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she [was] barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p>
      <p>{25:22} And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why [am] I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</p>
      <p>{25:23} And the LORD said unto her, Two nations [are] in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and [the one] people shall be stronger than [the other] people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
      <p>{25:24} And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, [there were] twins in her womb.</p>
      <p>{25:25} And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</p>
      <p>{25:26} And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac [was] threescore years old when she bare them.</p>
      <p>{25:27} And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob [was] a plain man, dwelling in tents.</p>
      <p>{25:28} And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of [his] venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
      <p>{25:29} And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he [was] faint:</p>
      <p>{25:30} And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage;] for I [am] faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</p>
      <p>{25:31} And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</p>
      <p>{25:32} And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</p>
      <p>{25:33} And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</p>
      <p>{25:34} Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised [his] birthright.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 26</h4>
      <p>{26:1} And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</p>
      <p>{26:2} And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</p>
      <p>{26:3} Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</p>
      <p>{26:4} And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</p>
      <p>{26:5} Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
      <p>{26:6} And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</p>
      <p>{26:7} And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he,] the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon.</p>
