      <h4>Genesis 25</h4>
      <p>25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name <i>was</i> Keturah.</p>
      <p>25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>
      <p>25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</p>
      <p>25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these <i>were</i> the children of Keturah.</p>
      <p>25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</p>
      <p>25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</p>
      <p>25:7 And these <i>are</i> the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</p>
      <p>25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full <i>of years;</i> and was gathered to his people.</p>
      <p>25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which <i>is</i> before Mamre;</p>
      <p>25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>
      <p>25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.</p>
      <p>25:12 Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</p>
      <p>25:13 And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p>
      <p>25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p>
      <p>25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</p>
      <p>25:16 These <i>are</i> the sons of Ishmael, and these <i>are</i> their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</p>
      <p>25:17 And these <i>are</i> the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</p>
      <p>25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that <i>is</i> before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: <i>and</i> he died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
      <p>25:19 And these <i>are</i> the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:</p>
      <p>25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</p>
      <p>25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she <i>was</i> barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p>
      <p>25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If <i>it be</i> so, why <i>am</i> I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</p>
      <p>25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations <i>are</i> in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and <i>the one</i> people shall be stronger than <i>the other</i> people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
      <p>25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, <i>there were</i> twins in her womb.</p>
      <p>25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</p>
      <p>25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac <i>was</i> threescore years old when she bare them.</p>
      <p>25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob <i>was</i> a plain man, dwelling in tents.</p>
      <p>25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of <i>his</i> venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
      <p>25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he <i>was</i> faint:</p>
      <p>25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red <i>pottage;</i> for I <i>am</i> faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</p>
      <p>25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</p>
      <p>25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I <i>am</i> at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</p>
      <p>25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</p>
      <p>25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised <i>his</i> birthright.</p>
