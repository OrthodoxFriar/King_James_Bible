      <p>{28:10} And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.</p>
      <p>{28:11} And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and [put] them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.</p>
      <p>{28:12} And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.</p>
      <p>{28:13} And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I [am] the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;</p>
      <p>{28:14} And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</p>
      <p>{28:15} And, behold, I [am] with thee, and will keep thee in all [places] whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done [that] which I have spoken to thee of.</p>
      <p>{28:16} And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew [it] not.</p>
      <p>{28:17} And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful [is] this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of heaven.</p>
      <p>{28:18} And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put [for] his pillows, and set it up [for] a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.</p>
      <p>{28:19} And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city [was called] Luz at the first.</p>
      <p>{28:20} And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</p>
      <p>{28:21} So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:</p>
      <p>{28:22} And this stone, which I have 
set [for] a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou 
shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 29</h4>
      <p>{29:1} Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.</p>
      <p>{29:2} And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there [were] three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone [was] upon the well's mouth.</p>
      <p>{29:3} And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.</p>
      <p>{29:4} And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence [be] ye? And they said, Of Haran [are] we.</p>
      <p>{29:5} And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know [him. ]</p>
      <p>{29:6} And he said unto them, [Is] he well? And they said, [He is] well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</p>
      <p>{29:7} And he said, Lo, [it is] yet high day, neither [is it] time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go [and] feed [them. ]</p>
      <p>{29:8} And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and [till] they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.</p>
      <p>{29:9} And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.</p>
      <p>{29:10} And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.</p>
