      <h4>Genesis 23</h4>
      <p>23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: <i>these were</i> the years of the life of Sarah.</p>
      <p>23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same <i>is</i> Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</p>
      <p>23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,</p>
      <p>23:4 I <i>am</i> a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</p>
      <p>23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>
      <p>23:6 Hear us, my lord: thou <i>art</i> a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</p>
      <p>23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, <i>even</i> to the children of Heth.</p>
      <p>23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</p>
      <p>23:9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which <i>is</i> in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.</p>
      <p>23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, <i>even</i> of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,</p>
      <p>23:11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that <i>is</i> therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.</p>
      <p>23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.</p>
      <p>23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou <i>wilt give it,</i> I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take <i>it</i> of me, and I will bury my dead there.</p>
      <p>23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>
      <p>23:15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land <i>is worth</i> four hundred shekels of silver; what <i>is</i> that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.</p>
      <p>23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current <i>money</i> with the merchant.</p>
      <p>23:17 And the field of Ephron, which <i>was</i> in Machpelah, which <i>was</i> before Mamre, the field, and the cave which <i>was</i> therein, and all the trees that <i>were</i> in the field, that <i>were</i> in all the borders round about, were made sure</p>
      <p>23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.</p>
      <p>23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same <i>is</i> Hebron in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>23:20 And the field, and the cave that <i>is</i> therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the sons of Heth.</p>
