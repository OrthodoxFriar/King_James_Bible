      <p>{23:5} And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>
      <p>{23:6} Hear us, my lord: thou [art] a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</p>
      <p>{23:7} And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, [even] to the children of Heth.</p>
      <p>{23:8} And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</p>
      <p>{23:9} That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which [is] in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.</p>
      <p>{23:10} And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, [even] of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,</p>
      <p>{23:11} Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that [is] therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.</p>
      <p>{23:12} And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.</p>
      <p>{23:13} And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou [wilt give it,] I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take [it] of me, and I will bury my dead there.</p>
      <p>{23:14} And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>
      <p>{23:15} My lord, hearken unto me: the land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver; what [is] that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.</p>
      <p>{23:16} And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current [money] with the merchant.</p>
      <p>{23:17} And the field of Ephron, which [was] in Machpelah, which [was] before Mamre, the field, and the cave which [was] therein, and all the trees that [were] in the field, that [were] in all the borders round about, were made sure</p>
      <p>{23:18} Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.</p>
      <p>{23:19} And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same [is] Hebron in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>{23:20} And the field, and the cave that [is] therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the sons of Heth.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 24</h4>
      <p>{24:1} And Abraham was old, [and] well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.</p>
      <p>{24:2} And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:</p>
      <p>{24:3} And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:</p>
      <p>{24:4} But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</p>
      <p>{24:5} And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou earnest?</p>
