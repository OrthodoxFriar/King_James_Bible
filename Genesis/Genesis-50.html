      <p>{1:2} Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</p> 
      <p>{1:3} Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</p>
      <p>{1:4} Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</p>
      <p>{1:5} And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt [already. ]</p>
      <p>{1:6} And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</p>
      <p>{1:7} And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</p>
      <p>{1:8} Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</p>
      <p>{1:9} And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel [are] more and mightier than we:</p>
      <p>{1:10} Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] get them up out of the land.</p>
      <p>{1:11} Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</p>
      <p>{1:12} But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>{1:13} And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</p>
      <p>{1:14} And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, [was] with rigour.</p>
      <p>{1:15} And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</p>
      <p>{1:16} And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see [them] upon the stools; if it [be] a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it [be] a daughter, then she shall live.</p>
      <p>{1:17} But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</p>
      <p>{1:18} And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</p>
      <p>{1:19} And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not as the Egyptian women; for they [are] lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</p>
      <p>{1:20} Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</p>
      <p>{1:21} And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</p>
      <p>{1:22} And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 2</h4>
      <p>{2:1} And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took [to wife] a daughter of Levi.</p>
      <p>{2:2} And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he [was a] goodly [child,] she hid him three months.</p>
      <p>{2:3} And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid [it] in the flags by the river's brink.</p>
      <p>{2:4} And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</p>
      <p>{2:5} And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash [herself] at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</p>
      <p>{2:6} And when she had opened [it,] she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This [is one] of the Hebrews' children.</p>
      <p>{2:7} Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</p>
      <p>{2:8} And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.</p>
