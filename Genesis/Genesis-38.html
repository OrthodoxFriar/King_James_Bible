      <p>{38:21} Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where [is] the harlot, that [was] openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this [place. ]</p>
      <p>{38:22} And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, [that] there was no harlot in this [place. ]</p>
      <p>{38:23} And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</p>
      <p>{38:24} And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</p>
      <p>{38:25} When she [was] brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these [are, am] I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</p>
      <p>{38:26} And Judah acknowledged [them,] and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</p>
      <p>{38:27} And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins [were] in her womb.</p>
      <p>{38:28} And it came to pass, when she travailed, that [the one] put out [his] hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,</p>
      <p>{38:29} And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? [this] breach [be] upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</p>
      <p>{38:30} And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 39</h4> 
      <p>{39:1} And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</p>
      <p>{39:2} And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</p>
      <p>{39:3} And his master saw that the LORD [was] with him, and that the LORD made all [that] he did to prosper in his hand.</p>
      <p>{39:4} And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</p>
      <p>{39:5} And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</p>
      <p>{39:6} And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was [a] goodly [person,] and well favoured.</p>
      <p>{39:7} And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</p>
      <p>{39:8} But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what [is] with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;</p>
      <p>{39:9} [There is] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</p>
      <p>{39:10} And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her.</p>
      <p>{39:11} And it came to pass about this time, that [Joseph] went into the house to do his business; and [there was] none of the men of the house there within.</p>
      <p>{39:12} And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</p>
      <p>{39:13} And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</p>
      <p>{39:14} That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</p>
      <p>{39:15} And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</p>
      <p>{39:16} And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</p>
      <p>{39:17} And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</p>
      <p>{39:18} And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</p>
      <p>{39:19} And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</p>
      <p>{39:20} And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison.</p>
      <p>{39:21} But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</p>
