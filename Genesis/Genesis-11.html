         <p>{11:4} And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
         <p>{11:5} And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</p>
         <p>{11:6} And the LORD said, Behold, the people [is] one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>
         <p>{11:7} Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.</p>
         <p>{11:8} So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>
         <p>{11:9} Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>
         <p>{11:10} These [are] the generations of Shem: Shem [was] an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:</p>
         <p>{11:11} And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
         <p>{11:12} And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</p>
         <p>{11:13} And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
         <p>{11:14} And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>
         <p>{11:15} And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
         <p>{11:16} And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</p>
         <p>{11:17} And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
         <p>{11:18} And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>
         <p>{11:19} And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
         <p>{11:20} And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</p>
         <p>{11:21} And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
         <p>{11:22} And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>
         <p>{11:23} And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
         <p>{11:24} And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</p>
         <p>{11:25} And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
         <p>{11:26} And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>
         <p>{11:27} Now these [are] the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</p>
         <p>{11:28} And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>
         <p>{11:29} And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram' s wife [was] Sarai; and the name of Nahor' s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</p>
         <p>{11:30} But Sarai was barren; she [had] no child.</p>
         <p>{11:31} And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram' s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>
         <p>{11:32} And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</p>
         <h4>Genesis 12</h4>
         <p>{12:1} Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:</p>
         <p>{12:2} And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>
         <p>{12:3} And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</p>
         <p>{12:4} So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram [was] seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</p>
