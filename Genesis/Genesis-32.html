      <p>{32:14} Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</p>
      <p>{32:15} Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</p>
      <p>{32:16} And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</p>
      <p>{32:17} And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose [art] thou? and whither goest thou? and whose [are] these before thee?</p>
      <p>{32:18} Then thou shalt say, [They be] thy servant Jacob's; it [is] a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he [is] behind us.</p>
      <p>{32:19} And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</p>
      <p>{32:20} And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</p>
      <p>{32:21} So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</p>
      <p>{32:22} And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</p>
      <p>{32:23} And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</p>
      <p>{32:24} And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</p>
      <p>{32:25} And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>
      <p>{32:26} And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>
      <p>{32:27} And he said unto him, What [is] thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p>
      <p>{32:28} And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</p>
      <p>{32:29} And Jacob asked [him,] and said, Tell [me,] I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore [is] it [that] thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</p>
      <p>{32:30} And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
      <p>{32:31} And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</p>
      <p>{32:32} Therefore the children of Israel eat not [of] the sinew which shrank, which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 33</h4>
      <p>{33:1} And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.</p>
      <p>{33:2} And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.</p>
      <p>{33:3} And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p>
      <p>{33:4} And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</p>
      <p>{33:5} And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who [are] those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.</p>
      <p>{33:6} Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</p>
      <p>{33:7} And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</p>
      <p>{33:8} And he said, What [meanest] thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, [These are] to find grace in the sight of my lord.</p>
      <p>{33:9} And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.</p>
      <p>{33:10} And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.</p>
      <p>{33:11} Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took [it. ]</p>
      <p>{33:12} And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.</p>
      <p>{33:13} And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender, and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</p>
      <p>{33:14} Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.</p>
