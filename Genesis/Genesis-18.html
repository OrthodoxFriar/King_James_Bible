         <h4>Genesis 18</h4>
         <p>18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</p>
         <p>18:2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw <i>them,</i> he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</p>
         <p>18:3 And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</p>
         <p>18:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</p>
         <p>18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>
         <p>18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead <i>it,</i> and make cakes upon the hearth.</p>
         <p>18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave <i>it</i> unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</p>
         <p>18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set <i>it</i> before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>
         <p>18:9 And they said unto him, Where <i>is</i> Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</p>
         <p>18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard <i>it</i> in the tent door, which <i>was</i> behind him.</p>
         <p>18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah <i>were</i> old <i>and</i> well stricken in age; <i>and</i> it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</p>
         <p>18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</p>
         <p>18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</p>
         <p>18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</p>
         <p>18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>
         <p>18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</p>
         <p>18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</p>
         <p>18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</p>
         <p>18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</p>
         <p>18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</p>
         <p>18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</p>
         <p>18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</p>
         <p>18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</p>
         <p>18:24 Perad venture there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that <i>are</i> therein?</p>
         <p>18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</p>
         <p>18:26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</p>
         <p>18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which <i>am but</i> dust and ashes:</p>
         <p>18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for <i>lack of</i> five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy <i>it. </i></p>
         <p>18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do <i>it</i> for forty's sake.</p>
         <p>18:30 And he said <i>unto him,</i> Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do <i>it,</i> if I find thirty there.</p>
         <p>18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy <i>it</i> for twenty's sake.</p>
         <p>18:32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy <i>it</i> for ten's sake.</p>
         <p>18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>
