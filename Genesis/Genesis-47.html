      <p>{47:30} But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.</p>
      <p>{47:31} And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 48</h4>
      <p>{48:1} And it came to pass after these things, that [one] told Joseph, Behold, thy father [is] sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</p>
      <p>{48:2} And [one] told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</p>
      <p>{48:3} And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</p>
      <p>{48:4} And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession.</p>
      <p>{48:5} And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, [are] mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</p>
      <p>{48:6} And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, [and] shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</p>
      <p>{48:7} And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet [there was] but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</p>
      <p>{48:8} And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who [are] these?</p>
      <p>{48:9} And Joseph said unto his father, They [are] my sons, whom God hath given me in this [place.] And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</p>
      <p>{48:10} Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, [so that] he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</p>
      <p>{48:11} And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</p>
      <p>{48:12} And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</p>
      <p>{48:13} And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought [them] near unto him.</p>
      <p>{48:14} And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim' s head, who [was] the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh' s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh [was] the firstborn.</p>
      <p>{48:15} And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</p>
      <p>{48:16} The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</p>
      <p>{48:17} And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.</p>
      <p>{48:18} And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this [is] the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</p>
      <p>{48:19} And his father refused, and said, I know [it,] my son, I know [it:] he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</p>
      <p>{48:20} And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>
      <p>{48:21} And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</p>
      <p>{48:22} Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 49</h4>
      <p>{49:1} And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you [that] which shall befall you in the last days.</p>
      <p>{49:2} Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</p>
      <p>{49:3} Reuben, thou [art] my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</p>
      <p>{49:4} Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou [it:] he went up to my couch.</p>
      <p>{49:5} Simeon and Levi [are] brethren; instruments of cruelty [are in] their habitations.</p>
      <p>{49:6} O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</p> 
      <p>{49:7} Cursed [be] their anger, for [it was] fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</p>
