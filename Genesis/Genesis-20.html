         <h4>Genesis 20</h4>
         <p>20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>
         <p>20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She <i>is</i> my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</p>
         <p>20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou <i>art but</i> a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she <i>is</i> a man's wife.</p>
         <p>20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?</p>
         <p>20:5 Said he not unto me, She <i>is</i> my sister? and she, even she herself said, He <i>is</i> my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</p>
         <p>20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</p>
         <p>20:7 Now therefore restore the man <i>his</i> wife; for he <i>is</i> a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore <i>her</i> not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that <i>are</i> thine.</p>
         <p>20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</p>
         <p>20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</p>
         <p>20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</p>
         <p>20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God <i>is</i> not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</p>
         <p>20:12 And yet indeed <i>she is</i> my sister; she <i>is</i> the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</p>
         <p>20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This <i>is</i> thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He <i>is</i> my brother.</p>
         <p>20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave <i>them</i> unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.</p>
         <p>20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land <i>is</i> before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</p>
         <p>20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver: behold, he <i>is</i> to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that <i>are</i> with thee, and with all <i>other:</i> thus she was reproved.</p>
         <p>20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare <i>children. </i></p>
         <p>20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</p>
