      <p>{41:24} And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told [this] unto the magicians; but [there was] none that could declare [it] to me.</p>
      <p>{41:25} And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh [is] one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.</p>
      <p>{41:26} The seven good kine [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one.</p>
      <p>{41:27} And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</p>
      <p>{41:28} This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God [is] about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>{41:29} Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</p>
      <p>{41:30} And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</p>
      <p>{41:31} And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.</p>
      <p>{41:32} And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</p>
      <p>{41:33} Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{41:34} Let Pharaoh do [this,] and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</p>
      <p>{41:35} And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.</p>
      <p>{41:36} And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.</p>
      <p>{41:37} And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</p>
      <p>{41:38} And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is,] a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</p>
      <p>{41:39} And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art: ]</p>
      <p>{4 1:40} Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</p>
      <p>{41:41} And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{41:42} And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</p>
      <p>{41:43} And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{41:44} And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{41:45} And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over [all] the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{41:46} And Joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{41:47} And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</p>
      <p>{41:48} And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which [was] round about every city, laid he up in the same.</p>
      <p>{41:49} And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for [it was] without number.</p>
      <p>{41:50} And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On bare unto him.</p>
      <p>{41:51} And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, [said he,] hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.</p>
      <p>{41:52} And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be</p>
      <p>{41:53} And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.</p>
      <p>{41:54} And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</p>
      <p>{41:55} And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</p>
      <p>{41:56} And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{41:57} And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy [corn;] because that the famine was so sore in all lands.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 42</h4>
      <p>{42:1} Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?</p>
      <p>{42:2} And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.</p>
      <p>{42:3} And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.</p>
      <p>{42:4} But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.</p>
      <p>{42:5} And the sons of Israel came to buy [corn] among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>{42:6} And Joseph [was] the governor over the land, [and] he [it was] that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him [with] their faces to the earth.</p>
      <p>{42:7} And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</p>
      <p>{42:8} And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</p>
      <p>{42:9} And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye [are] spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</p>
      <p>{42:10} And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.</p>
      <p>{42:1 1} We [are] all one man's sons; we [are] true [men,] thy servants are no spies.</p>
      <p>{42:12} And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</p>
      <p>{42:13} And they said, Thy servants [are] twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest [is] this day with our father, and one [is] not.</p>
      <p>{42:14} And Joseph said unto them, That [is it] that I spake unto you, saying, Ye [are] spies:</p>
      <p>{42:15} Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.</p>
      <p>{42:16} Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether [there be any] truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye [are] spies.</p>
      <p>{42:17} And he put them all together into ward three days.</p>
      <p>{42:18} And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; [for] I fear God:</p>
      <p>{42:19} If ye [be] true [men,] let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:</p>
      <p>{42:20} But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</p>
      <p>{42:21} And they said one to another, We [are] verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</p>
      <p>{42:22} And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</p>
      <p>{42:23} And they knew not that Joseph understood [them;] for he spake unto them by an interpreter.</p>
      <p>{42:24} And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</p>
