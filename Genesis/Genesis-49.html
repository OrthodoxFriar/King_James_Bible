      <h4>Genesis 49</h4>
      <p>49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you <i>that</i> which shall befall you in the last days.</p>
      <p>49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</p>
      <p>49:3 Reuben, thou <i>art</i> my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</p>
      <p>49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou <i>it:</i> he went up to my couch.</p>
      <p>49:5 Simeon and Levi <i>are</i> brethren; instruments of cruelty <i>are in</i> their habitations.</p>
      <p>49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</p> 
      <p>49:7 Cursed <i>be</i> their anger, for <i>it was</i> fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</p>
      <p>49:8 Judah, thou <i>art he</i> whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand <i>shall be</i> in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.</p>
      <p>49:9 Judah <i>is</i> a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</p>
      <p>49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him <i>shall</i> the gathering of the people <i>be. </i></p>
      <p>49: 11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</p>
      <p>49:12 His eyes <i>shall be</i> red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</p>
      <p>49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he <i>shall be</i> for an haven of ships; and his border <i>shall be</i> unto Zidon.</p>
      <p>49:14 Issachar <i>is</i> a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</p>
      <p>49:15 And he saw that rest <i>was</i> good, and the land that <i>it was</i> pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</p>
      <p>49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
      <p>49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>
      <p>49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</p>
      <p>49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</p>
      <p>49:20 Out of Asher his bread <i>shall be</i> fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</p>
      <p>49:21 Naphtali <i>is</i> a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</p>
      <p>49:22 Joseph <i>is</i> a fruitful bough, <i>even</i> a fruitful bough by a well; <i>whose</i> branches run over the wall:</p>
      <p>49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot <i>at him,</i> and hated him:</p>
      <p>49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty <i>God</i> of Jacob; (from thence <i>is</i> the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</p>
      <p>49:25 <i>Even</i> by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</p>
      <p>49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</p>
      <p>49:27 Benjamin shall ravin <i>as</i> a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</p>
      <p>49:28 All these <i>are</i> the twelve tribes of Israel: and this <i>is it</i> that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</p>
      <p>49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that <i>is</i> in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</p>
      <p>49:30 In the cave that <i>is</i> in the field of Machpelah, which <i>is</i> before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</p>
      <p>49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</p>
      <p>49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that <i>is</i> therein <i>was</i> from the children of Heth.</p>
      <p>49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</p>
