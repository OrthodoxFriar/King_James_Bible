      <p>{49:32} The purchase of the field and of the cave that [is] therein [was] from the children of Heth.</p>
      <p>{49:33} And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</p>
      <h4>Genesis 50</h4>
      <p>{50:1} And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.</p>
      <p>{50:2} And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</p>
      <p>{50:3} And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</p>
      <p>{50:4} And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</p>
      <p>{50:5} My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</p>
      <p>{50:6} And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee</p>
      <p>{50:7} And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</p>
      <p>{50:8} And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</p>
      <p>{50:9} And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</p>
      <p>{50:10} And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which [is] beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</p>
      <p>{50:11} And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This [is] a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which [is] beyond Jordan.</p>
      <p>{50:12} And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</p>
      <p>{50:13} For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</p>
      <p>{50:14} And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</p>
      <p>{50:15} And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</p>
      <p>{50:16} And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</p>
      <p>{50:17} So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</p>
      <p>{50:18} And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we [be] thy servants.</p>
      <p>{50:19} And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for [am] I in the place of God?</p> 
      <p>{50:20} But as for you, ye thought evil against me; [but] God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as [it is] this day, to save much people alive.</p>
      <p>{50:21} Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</p>
      <p>{50:22} And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</p> 
      <p>{50:23} And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third [generation:] the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</p>
      <p>{50:24}And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die:and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
      <p>{50:25} And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</p>
      <p>{50:26} So Joseph died, [being] an hundred and ten years 
old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in 
Egypt.</p> 

      <h3 id="Exodus">The Second Book of Moses, Called Exodus</h3>
      <h4>Exodus 1</h4>
      <p>{1:1} Now these [are] the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</p>
