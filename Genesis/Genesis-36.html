      <h4>Genesis 36</h4>
      <p>36:1 Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Esau, who <i>is</i> Edom.</p>
      <p>36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;</p>
      <p>36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.</p>
      <p>36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;</p>
      <p>36:5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these <i>are</i> the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.</p>
      <p>36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.</p>
