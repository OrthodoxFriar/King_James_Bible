      <h3>The Readings from the Psalms</h3>
      <h4>Psalm 50</h4>
      <h5>A Psalm of Asaph.</h5>
      <p>{50:1} The mighty God, [even] the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</p>
<p>{50:2} Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</p>
<p>{50:3} Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</p>
<p>{50:4} He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</p>
<p>{50:5} Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</p>
<p>{50:6} And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God [is] judge himself. Selah.</p>
<p>{50:7} Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I [am] God, [even] thy God.</p>
<p>{50:8} I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, [to have been] continually before me.</p>
<p>{50:9} I will take no bullock out of thy house, [nor] he goats out of thy folds.</p>
<p>{50:10} For every beast of the forest [is] mine, [and] the cattle upon a thousand hills.</p>
<p>{50:11} I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field [are] mine.</p>
<p>{50:12} If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world [is] mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p>{50:13} Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</p>
<p>{50:14} Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</p>
<p>{50:15} And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</p>
<p>{50:16} But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or [that] thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</p>
<p>{50:17} Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.</p>
<p>{50:18} When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</p>
<p>{50:19} Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</p>
<p>{50:20} Thou sittest [and] speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.</p>
<p>{50:21} These [things] hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether [such an one] as thyself: [but] I will reprove thee, and set [them] in order before thine eyes.</p>
<p>{50:22} Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear [you] in pieces, and [there be] none to deliver.</p>
<p>{50:23} Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth [his] conversation [aright] will I shew the salvation of God.</p>

<h4>Psalm 46</h4>
<h5>To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth.</h5>
<p>{46:1} God [is] our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</p>
<p>{46:2} Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;</p>
<p>{46:3} [Though] the waters thereof roar [and] be troubled, [though] the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.</p>
<p>{46:4} [There is] a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy [place] of the tabernacles of the most High.</p>
<p>{46:5} God [is] in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, [and that] right early.</p>
<p>{46:6} The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</p>
<p>{46:7} The LORD of hosts [is] with us; the God of Jacob [is] our refuge. Selah.</p>
<p>{46:8} Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</p>
<p>{46:9} He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.</p>
<p>{46:10} Be still, and know that I [am] God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.</p>
<p>{46:11} The LORD of hosts [is] with us; the God of Jacob [is] our refuge. Selah.</p>

<h4>Psalm 97</h4>
<p>{97:1} The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad [thereof.]</p>
<p>{97:2} Clouds and darkness [are] round about him: righteousness and judgment [are] the habitation of his throne.</p>
<p>{97:3} A fire goeth before him, and burnetii up his enemies round about.</p>
<p>{97:4} His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.</p>
<p>{97:5} The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
<p>{97:6} The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.</p>
<p>{97:7} Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all [ye] gods.</p>
<p>{97:8} Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.</p>
<p>{97:9} For thou, LORD, [art] high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.</p>
<p>{97:10} Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p>{97:11} Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</p>
<p>{97:12} Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>
