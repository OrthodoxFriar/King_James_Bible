      <p>{19:22} And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</p>
      <p>{19:23} And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</p>
      <p>{19:24} And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</p>
      <p>{19:25} So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 20</h4>
      <p>{20:1} And God spake all these words, saying,</p>
      <p>{20:2} I [am] the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p>
      <p>{20:3} Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p>
      <p>{20:4} Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth:</p>
      <p>{20:5} Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me;</p>
      <p>{20:6} And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</p>
      <p>{20:7} Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>
      <p>{20:8} Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</p>
      <p>{20:9} Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</p>
      <p>{20:10} But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates:</p>
      <p>{20:11} For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is,] and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
      <p>{20:12} Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
      <p>{20:13} Thou shalt not kill.</p>
      <p>{20:14} Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>
      <p>{20:15} Thou shalt not steal.</p>
      <p>{20:16} Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p>
      <p>{20:17} Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that [is] thy neighbour's.</p>
      <p>{20:18} And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw [it,] they removed, and stood afar off.</p>
      <p>{20:19} And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</p>
      <p>{20:20} And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.</p>
      <p>{20:21} And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God [was. ]</p>
      <p>{20:22} And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</p>
      <p>{20:23} Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.</p>
      <p>{20:24} An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.</p>
