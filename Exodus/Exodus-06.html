      <p>{7:7} And Moses [was] fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.</p>
      <p>{7:8} And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
      <p>{7:9} When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast [it] before Pharaoh, [and] it shall become a serpent.</p>
      <p>{7:10} And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</p>
      <p>{7:11} Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.</p>
      <p>{7:12} For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.</p>
      <p>{7:13} And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>
      <p>{7:14} And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart [is] hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.</p>
      <p>{7:15} Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</p>
      <p>{7:16} And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</p>
      <p>{7:17} Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that [is] in mine hand upon the waters which [are] in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</p>
      <p>{7:18} And the fish that [is] in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.</p>
      <p>{7:19} And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and [that] there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in [vessels of] wood, and in [vessels of] stone.</p>
      <p>{7:20} And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that [were] in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that [were] in the river were turned to blood.</p>
      <p>{7:21} And the fish that [was] in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{7:22} And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>
      <p>{7:23} And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.</p>
      <p>{7:24} And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.</p>
      <p>{7:25} And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 8</h4>
      <p>{8:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
      <p>{8:2} And if thou refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:</p>
      <p>{8:3} And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:</p>
      <p>{8:4} And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.</p>
      <p>{8:5} And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{8:6} And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{8:7} And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{8:8} Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{8:9} And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, [that] they may remain in the river only?</p>
      <p>{8:10} And he said, To morrow. And he said, [Be it] according to thy word: that thou mayest know that [there is] none like unto the LORD our God.</p>
      <p>{8:11} And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.</p>
      <p>{8:12} And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.</p>
