      <p>{33:8} And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, [that] all the people rose up, and stood every man [at] his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>{33:9} And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood [at] the door of the tabernacle, and [the] LORD talked with Moses.</p>
      <p>{33:10} And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand [at] the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man [in] his tent door.</p>
      <p>{33:11} And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</p>
      <p>{33:12} And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.</p>
      <p>{33:13} Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation [is] thy people.</p>
      <p>{33:14} And he said, My presence shall go [with thee,] and I will give thee rest.</p>
      <p>{33:15} And he said unto him, If thy presence go not [with me,] carry us not up hence.</p>
      <p>{33:16} For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? [is it] not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that [are] upon the face of the earth.</p>
      <p>{33:17} And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.</p>
      <p>{33:18} And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.</p>
      <p>{33:19} And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</p>
      <p>{33:20} And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</p>
      <p>{33:21} And the LORD said, Behold, [there is] a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:</p>
      <p>{33:22} And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:</p>
      <p>{33:23} And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 34</h4>
      <p>{34:1} And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon [these] tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.</p>
      <p>{34:2} And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.</p>
      <p>{34:3} And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.</p>
