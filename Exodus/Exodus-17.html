      <p>{19:4} Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and [how] I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.</p>
      <p>{19:5} Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth [is] mine:</p>
      <p>{19:6} And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These [are] the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.</p>
      <p>{19:7} And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</p>
      <p>{19:8} And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{19:9} And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{19:10} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</p>
      <p>{19:11} And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</p>
      <p>{19:12} And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, [that ye] go [not] up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</p>
      <p>{19:13} There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether [it be] beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</p>
      <p>{19:14} And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</p>
      <p>{19:15} And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at [your] wives.</p>
      <p>{19:16} And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that [was] in the camp trembled.</p>
      <p>{19:17} And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</p>
      <p>{19:18} And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</p>
      <p>{19:19} And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.</p>
      <p>{19:20} And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses [up] to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</p>
      <p>{19:21} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</p>
