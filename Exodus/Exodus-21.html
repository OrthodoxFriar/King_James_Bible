      <p>{22:16} And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</p>
      <p>{22:17} If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>
      <p>{22:18} Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</p>
      <p>{22:19} Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>{22:20} He that sacrificeth unto [any] god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</p>
      <p>{22:21} Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{22:22} Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</p>
      <p>{22:23} If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;</p>
      <p>{22:24} And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</p>
      <p>{22:25} If thou lend money to [any of] my people [that is] poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</p>
      <p>{22:26} If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:</p>
      <p>{22:27} For that [is] his covering only, it [is] his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I [am] gracious.</p>
      <p>{22:28} Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.</p>
      <p>{22:29} Thou shalt not delay [to offer] the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</p>
      <p>{22:30} Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, [and] with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.</p>
      <p>{22:31} And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat [any] flesh [that is] torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 23</h4>
      <p>{23:1} Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.</p>
      <p>{23:2} Thou shalt not follow a multitude to [do] evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest [judgment: ]</p>
      <p>{23:3} Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.</p>
      <p>{23:4} If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</p>
      <p>{23:5} If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.</p>
      <p>{23:6} Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.</p>
      <p>{23:7} Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.</p>
      <p>{23:8} And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</p>
      <p>{23:9} Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{23:10} And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:</p>
      <p>{23:11} But the seventh [year] thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, [and] with thy oliveyard.</p>
      <p>{23:12} Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.</p>
      <p>{23:13} And in all [things] that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</p>
      <p>{23:14} Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.</p>
      <p>{23:15} Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou earnest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)</p>
      <p>{23:16} And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, [which is] in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</p>
      <p>{23:17} Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.</p>
      <p>{23:18} Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</p>
      <p>{23:19} The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.</p>
      <p>{23:20} Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</p>
      <p>{23:21} Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name [is] in him.</p>
