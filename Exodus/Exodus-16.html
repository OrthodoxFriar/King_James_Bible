      <p>{17:11} And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</p>
      <p>{17:12} But Moses' hands [were] heavy; and they took a stone, and put [it] under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</p>
      <p>{17:13} And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</p>
      <p>{17:14} And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this [for] a memorial in a book, and rehearse [it] in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</p>
      <p>{17:15} And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah- nissi:</p>
      <p>{17:16} For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn [that] the LORD [will have] war with Amalek from generation to generation.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 18</h4>
      <p>{18:1} When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, [and] that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;</p>
      <p>{18:2} Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,</p>
      <p>{18:3} And her two sons; of which the name of the one [was] Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:</p>
      <p>{18:4} And the name of the other [was] Eliezer; for the God of my father, [said he, was] mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:</p>
      <p>{18:5} And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:</p>
      <p>{18:6} And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.</p>
      <p>{18:7} And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of [their] welfare; and they came into the tent.</p>
      <p>{18:8} And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, [and] all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and [how] the LORD delivered them.</p>
      <p>{18:9} And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>{18:10} And Jethro said, Blessed [be] the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>{18:11} Now I know that the LORD [is] greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly [he was] above them.</p>
      <p>{18:12} And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.</p>
      <p>{18:13} And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</p>
      <p>{18:14} And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What [is] this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</p>
      <p>{18:15} And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:</p>
      <p>{18:16} When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make [them] know the statutes of God, and his laws.</p>
      <p>{18:17} And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest [is] not good.</p>
      <p>{18:18} Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that [is] with thee: for this thing [is] too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</p>
      <p>{18:19} Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</p>
      <p>{18:20} And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</p>
      <p>{18:21} Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place [such] over them, [to be] rulers of thousands, [and] rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</p>
      <p>{18:22} And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, [that] every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear [the burden] with thee.</p>
      <p>{18:23} If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee [so,] then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</p>
      <p>{18:24} So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</p>
      <p>{18:25} And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</p>
      <p>{18:26} And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</p>
      <p>{18:27} And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 19</h4>
      <p>{19:1} In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they [into] the wilderness of Sinai.</p>
      <p>{19:2} For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come [to] the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.</p>
      <p>{19:3} And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;</p>
