      <p>{27:20} And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.</p>
      <p>{27:21} In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which [is] before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: [it shall be] a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 28</h4>
      <p>{28:1} And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, [even] Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.</p>
      <p>{28:2} And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty.</p>
      <p>{28:3} And thou shalt speak unto all [that are] wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.</p>
      <p>{28:4} And these [are] the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.</p>
      <p>{28:5} And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.</p>
      <p>{28:6} And they shall make the ephod [of] gold, [of] blue, and [of] purple, [of] scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.</p>
      <p>{28:7} It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and [so] it shall be joined together.</p>
      <p>{28:8} And the curious girdle of the ephod, which [is] upon it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; [even of] gold, [of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
      <p>{28:9} And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:</p>
      <p>{28:10} Six of their names on one stone, and [the other] six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.</p>
      <p>{28:11} With the work of an engraver in stone, [like] the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold.</p>
      <p>{28:12} And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod [for] stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial.</p>
      <p>{28:13} And thou shalt make ouches [of] gold;</p>
      <p>{28:14} And two chains [of] pure gold at the ends; [of] wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.</p>
      <p>{28:15} And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; [of] gold, [of] blue, and [of] purple, and [of] scarlet, and [of] fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.</p>
      <p>{28:16} Foursquare it shall be [being] doubled; a span [shall be] the length thereof, and a span [shall be] the breadth thereof.</p>
      <p>{28:17} And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, [even] four rows of stones: [the first] row [shall be] a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: [this shall be] the first row.</p>
      <p>{28:18} And the second row [shall be] an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.</p>
      <p>{28:19} And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.</p>
      <p>{28:20} And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be set in gold in their inclosings.</p>
      <p>{28:21} And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, [like] the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.</p>
      <p>{28:22} And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends [of] wreathen work [of] pure gold.</p>
      <p>{28:23} And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.</p>
      <p>{28:24} And thou shalt put the two wreathen [chains] of gold in the two rings [which are] on the ends of the breastplate.</p>
      <p>{28:25} And [the other] two ends of the two wreathen [chains] thou shalt fasten in the two ouches, and put [them] on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it.</p>
      <p>{28:26} And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which [is] in the side of the ephod inward.</p>
      <p>{28:27} And two [other] rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the [other] coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.</p>
      <p>{28:28} And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that [it] may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.</p>
      <p>{28:29} And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy [place,] for a memorial before the LORD continually.</p>
      <p>{28:30} And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.</p>
      <p>{28:31} And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all [of] blue.</p>
      <p>{28:32} And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.</p>
      <p>{28:33} And [beneath] upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates [of] blue, and [of] purple, and [of] scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:</p>
      <p>{28:34} A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.</p>
      <p>{28:35} And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy [place] before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not.</p>
      <p>{28:36} And thou shalt make a plate [of] pure gold, and grave upon it, [like] the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</p>
