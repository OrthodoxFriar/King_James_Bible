      <p>{29:16} And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle [it] round about upon the altar.</p>
      <p>{29:17} And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put [them] unto his pieces, and unto his head.</p>
      <p>{29:18} And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it [is] a burnt offering unto the LORD: it [is] a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{29:19} And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
      <p>{29:20} Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put [it] upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
      <p>{29:21} And thou shalt take of the blood that [is] upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle [it] upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.</p>
      <p>{29:22} Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the [caul] above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that [is] upon them, and the right shoulder; for it [is] a ram of consecration:</p>
      <p>{29:23} And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that [is] before the LORD:</p>
      <p>{29:24} And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them [for] a wave offering before the LORD.</p>
      <p>{29:25} And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn [them] upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it [is] an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{29:26} And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it [for] a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.</p>
      <p>{29:27} And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, [even] of [that] which [is] for Aaron, and of [that] which is for his sons:</p>
      <p>{29:28} And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it [is] an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, [even] their heave offering unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{29:29} And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.</p>
      <p>{29:30} [And] that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy [place. ]</p>
      <p>{29:31} And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.</p>
      <p>{29:32} And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that [is] in the basket, [by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>{29:33} And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate [and] to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat [thereof,] because they [are] holy.</p>
      <p>{29:34} And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it [is] holy.</p>
      <p>{29:35} And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all [things] which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.</p>
      <p>{29:36} And thou shalt offer every day a bullock [for] a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.</p>
      <p>{29:37} Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.</p>
      <p>{29:38} Now this [is that] which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.</p>
      <p>{29:39} The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:</p>
      <p>{29:40} And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine [for] a drink offering.</p>
      <p>{29:41} And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{29:42} [This shall be] a continual burnt offering throughout your generations [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.</p>
      <p>{29:43} And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and [the tabernacle] shall be sanctified by my glory.</p>
      <p>{29:44} And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.</p>
      <p>{29:45} And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.</p>
      <p>{29:46} And they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I [am] the LORD their God.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 30</h4>
      <p>{30:1} And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: [of] shittim wood shalt thou make it.</p>
      <p>{30:2} A cubit [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits [shall be] the height thereof: the horns thereof [shall be] of the same.</p>
      <p>{30:3} And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.</p>
      <p>{30:4} And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make [it;] and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.</p>
      <p>{30:5} And thou shalt make the staves [of] shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.</p>
      <p>{30:6} And thou shalt put it before the vail that [is] by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that [is] over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.</p>
      <p>{30:7} And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.</p>
      <p>{30:8} And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.</p>
      <p>{30:9} Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.</p>
      <p>{30:10} And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it [is] most holy unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{30:11} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>{30:12} When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when [thou] numberest them.</p>
      <p>{30:13} This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel [is] twenty gerahs:) an half shekel [shall be] the offering of the LORD.</p>
