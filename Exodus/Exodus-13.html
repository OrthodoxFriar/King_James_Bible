      <p>{14:22} And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry [ground:] and the waters [were] a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</p>
      <p>{14:23} And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, [even] all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>
      <p>{14:24} And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,</p>
      <p>{14:25} And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>{14:26} And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</p>
      <p>{14:27} And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</p>
      <p>{14:28} And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, [and] all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.</p>
      <p>{14:29} But the children of Israel walked upon dry [land] in the midst of the sea; and the waters [were] a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</p>
      <p>{14:30} Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.</p>
      <p>{14:31} And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 15</h4>
      <p>{15:1} Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</p>
      <p>{15:2} The LORD [is] my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he [is] my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.</p>
      <p>{15:3} The LORD [is] a man of war: the LORD [is] his name.</p>
      <p>{15:4} Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.</p>
      <p>{15:5} The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.</p>
      <p>{15:6} Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</p>
      <p>{15:7} And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, [which] consumed them as stubble.</p>
      <p>{15:8} And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, [and] the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.</p>
      <p>{15:9} The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</p>
      <p>{15:10} Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.</p>
      <p>{15:11} Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who [is] like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful [in] praises, doing wonders?</p>
      <p>{15:12} Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.</p>
      <p>{15:13} Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people [which] thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided [them] in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.</p>
