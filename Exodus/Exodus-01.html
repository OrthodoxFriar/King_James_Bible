      <p>{2:10} And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</p>
      <p>{2:11} And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</p>
      <p>{2:12} And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</p>
      <p>{2:13} And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</p>
      <p>{2:14} And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</p>
      <p>{2:15} Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</p>
      <p>{2:16} Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew [water,] and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</p>
      <p>{2:17} And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</p>
      <p>{2:18} And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How [is it that] ye are come so soon to day?</p>
      <p>{2:19} And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew [water] enough for us, and watered the flock.</p>
      <p>{2:20} And he said unto his daughters, And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</p>
      <p>{2:21} And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</p>
      <p>{2:22} And she bare [him] a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</p>
      <p>{2:23} And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</p>
      <p>{2:24} And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</p>
      <p>{2:25} And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto [them. ]</p>
      <h4>Exodus 3</h4>
      <p>{3:1} Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, [even] to Horeb.</p>
      <p>{3:2} And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush [was] not consumed.</p>
      <p>{3:3} And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</p>
      <p>{3:4} And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here [am] I.</p>
      <p>{3:5} And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</p>
      <p>{3:6} Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</p>
      <p>{3:7} And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which [are] in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</p>
