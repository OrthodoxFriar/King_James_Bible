      <p>{5:4} And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</p>
      <p>{5:5} And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now [are] many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</p>
      <p>{5:6} And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</p>
      <p>{5:7} Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</p>
      <p>{5:8} And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish [ought] thereof: for they [be] idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go [and] sacrifice to our God.</p>
      <p>{5:9} Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</p>
      <p>{5:10} And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</p>
      <p>{5:11} Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.</p>
      <p>{5:12} So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</p>
      <p>{5:13} And the taskmasters hasted [them,] saying, Fulfil your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw.</p>
      <p>{5:14} And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and] demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?</p>
      <p>{5:15} Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</p>
      <p>{5:16} There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants [are] beaten; but the fault [is] in thine own people.</p>
      <p>{5:17} But he said, Ye [are] idle, [ye are] idle: therefore ye say, Let us go [and] do sacrifice to the LORD.</p>
      <p>{5:18} Go therefore now, [and] work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.</p>
      <p>{5:19} And the officers of the children of Israel did see [that] they [were] in evil [case,] after it was said, Ye shall not minish [ought] from your bricks of your daily task.</p>
      <p>{5:20} And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</p>
      <p>{5:21} And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</p>
      <p>{5:22} And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou [so] evil entreated this people? why [is] it [that] thou hast sent me?</p>
      <p>{5:23} For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 6</h4>
      <p>{6:1} Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</p>
      <p>{6:2} And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I [am] the LORD:</p>
      <p>{6:3} And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by [the name of] God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</p>
      <p>{6:4} And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.</p>
      <p>{6:5} And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.</p>
      <p>{6:6} Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I [am] the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:</p>
      <p>{6:7} And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>{6:8} And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I [am] the LORD.</p>
      <p>{6:9} And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</p>
      <p>{6:10} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>{6:11} Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p>
      <p>{6:12} And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who [am] of uncircumcised lips?</p>
