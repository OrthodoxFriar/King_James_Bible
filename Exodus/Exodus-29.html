      <p>{30:14} Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{30:15} The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when [they] give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</p>
      <p>{30:16} And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</p>
      <p>{30:17} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>{30:18} Thou shalt also make a laver [of] brass, and his foot [also of] brass, to wash [withal:] and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.</p>
      <p>{30:19} For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:</p>
      <p>{30:20} When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:</p>
      <p>{30:21} So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, [even] to him and to his seed throughout their generations.</p>
      <p>{30:22} Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>{30:23} Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred [shekels,] and of sweet cinnamon half so much, [even] two hundred and fifty [shekels,] and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty [shekels, ]</p>
      <p>{30:24} And of cassia five hundred [shekels,] after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:</p>
      <p>{30:25} And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.</p>
      <p>{30:26} And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,</p>
      <p>{30:27} And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,</p>
      <p>{30:28} And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.</p>
      <p>{30:29} And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.</p>
      <p>{30:30} And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that [they] may minister unto me in the priest's office.</p>
      <p>{30:31} And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.</p>
      <p>{30:32} Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make [any other] like it, after the composition of it: it [is] holy, [and] it shall be holy unto you.</p>
      <p>{30:33} Whosoever compoundeth [any] like it, or whosoever putteth [any] of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.</p>
      <p>{30:34} And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; [these] sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like [weight: ]</p>
      <p>{30:35} And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure [and] holy:</p>
      <p>{30:36} And thou shalt beat [some] of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.</p>
      <p>{30:37} And [as for] the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.</p>
      <p>{30:38} Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 31</h4>
      <p>{31:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>{31:2} See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</p>
      <p>{31:3} And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,</p>
      <p>{31:4} To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</p>
      <p>{31:5} And in cutting of stones, to set [them,] and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.</p>
      <p>{31:6} And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;</p>
      <p>{31:7} The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that [is] thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,</p>
      <p>{31:8} And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,</p>
      <p>{31:9} And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,</p>
      <p>{31:10} And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,</p>
      <p>{31:11} And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy [place:] according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.</p>
      <p>{31:12} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>{31:13} Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I [am] the LORD that doth sanctify you.</p>
      <p>{31:14} Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it [is] holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth [any] work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
      <p>{31:15} Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth [any] work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>{31:16} Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, [for] a perpetual covenant.</p>
      <p>{31:17} It [is] a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</p>
      <p>{31:18} And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 32</h4>
      <p>{32:1} And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for [as for] this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p>
      <p>{32:2} And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which [are] in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring [them] unto me.</p>
      <p>{32:3} And all the people brake off the golden earrings which [were] in their ears, and brought [them] unto Aaron.</p>
