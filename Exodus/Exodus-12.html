      <p>{12:44} But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.</p>
      <p>{12:45} A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</p>
      <p>{12:46} In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</p>
      <p>{12:47} All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</p>
      <p>{12:48} And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</p>
      <p>{12:49} One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</p>
      <p>{12:50} Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</p>
      <p>{12:51} And it came to pass the selfsame day, [that] the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 13</h4>
      <p>{13:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>{13:2} Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, [both] of man and of beast: it [is] mine.</p>
      <p>{13:3} And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this [place:] there shall no leavened bread be eaten.</p>
      <p>{13:4} This day came ye out in the month Abib.</p>
      <p>{13:5} And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.</p>
      <p>{13:6} Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day [shall be] a feast to the LORD.</p>
      <p>{13:7} Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.</p>
      <p>{13:8} And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, [This is done] because of that [which] the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{13:9} And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{13:10} Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.</p>
      <p>{13:11} And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,</p>
      <p>{13:12} That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males [shall be] the LORD'S.</p>
      <p>{13:13} And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.</p>
      <p>{13:14} And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What [is] this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:</p>
      <p>{13:15} And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.</p>
      <p>{13:16} And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{13:17} And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not [through] the way of the land of the Philistines, although that [was] near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:</p>
      <p>{13:18} But God led the people about, [through] the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{13:19} And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.</p>
      <p>{13:20} And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.</p>
      <p>{13:21} And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:</p>
      <p>{13:22} He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, [from] before the people.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 14</h4>
      <p>{14:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
      <p>{14:2} Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.</p>
      <p>{14:3} For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They [are] entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.</p>
      <p>{14:4} And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I [am] the LORD. And they did so.</p>
      <p>{14:5} And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</p>
      <p>{14:6} And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:</p>
      <p>{14:7} And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</p>
      <p>{14:8} And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.</p>
      <p>{14:9} But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.</p>
      <p>{14:10} And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</p>
      <p>{14:11} And they said unto Moses, Because [there were] no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</p>
      <p>{14:12} [Is] not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For [it had been] better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</p>
      <p>{14:13} And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</p>
      <p>{14:14} The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</p>
      <p>{14:15} And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</p>
      <p>{14:16} But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.</p>
      <p>{14:17} And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</p>
      <p>{14:18} And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</p>
      <p>{14:19} And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:</p>
      <p>{14:20} And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness [to them,] but it gave light by night [to these:] so that the one came not near the other all the night.</p>
      <p>{14:21} And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry [land,] and the waters were divided.</p>
