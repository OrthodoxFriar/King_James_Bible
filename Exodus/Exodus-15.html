      <p>{16:19} And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</p>
      <p>{16:20} Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.</p>
      <p>{16:21} And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</p>
      <p>{16:22} And it came to pass, [that] on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one [man:] and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</p>
      <p>{16:23} And he said unto them, This [is that] which the LORD hath said, To morrow [is] the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake [that] which ye will bake [to day,] and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</p>
      <p>{16:24} And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.</p>
      <p>{16:25} And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day [is] a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.</p>
      <p>{16:26} Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, [which is] the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</p>
      <p>{16:27} And it came to pass, [that] there went out [some] of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.</p>
      <p>{16:28} And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?</p>
      <p>{16:29} See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</p>
      <p>{16:30} So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>
      <p>{16:31} And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it [was] like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it [was] like wafers [made] with honey.</p>
      <p>{16:32} And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</p>
      <p>{16:33} And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</p>
      <p>{16:34} As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</p>
      <p>{16:35} And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.</p>
      <p>{16:36} Now an omer [is] the tenth [part] of an ephah.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 17</h4>
      <p>{17:1} And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and [there was] no water for the people to drink.</p>
      <p>{17:2} Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?</p>
      <p>{17:3} And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore [is] this [that] thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</p>
      <p>{17:4} And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.</p>
      <p>{17:5} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</p>
      <p>{17:6} Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</p>
      <p>{17:7} And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?</p>
      <p>{17:8} Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</p>
      <p>{17:9} And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.</p>
      <p>{17:10} So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</p>
