      <p>{20:25} And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</p>
      <p>{20:26} Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 21</h4>
      <p>{21:1} Now these [are] the judgments which thou shalt set before them.</p>
      <p>{21:2} If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</p>
      <p>{21:3} If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.</p>
      <p>{21:4} If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.</p>
      <p>{21:5} And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:</p>
      <p>{21:6} Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.</p>
      <p>{21:7} And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.</p>
      <p>{21:8} If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.</p>
      <p>{21:9} And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</p>
      <p>{21:10} If he take him another [wife;] her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.</p>
      <p>{21:11} And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.</p>
      <p>{21:12} He that smite th a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.</p>
      <p>{21:13} And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver [him] into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</p>
      <p>{21:14} But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.</p>
      <p>{21:15} And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</p>
      <p>{21:16} And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>{21:17} And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</p>
      <p>{21:18} And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with [his] fist, and he die not, but keepeth [his] bed:</p>
      <p>{21:19} If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote [him] be quit: only he shall pay [for] the loss of his time, and shall cause [him] to be thoroughly healed.</p>
      <p>{21:20} And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.</p>
      <p>{21:21} Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he [is] his money.</p>
      <p>{21:22} If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart [from her,] and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges [determine. ]</p>
      <p>{21:23} And if [any] mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,</p>
      <p>{21:24} Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</p>
