      <p>{28:38} And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.</p>
      <p>{28:39} And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre [of] fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle [of] needlework.</p>
      <p>{28:40} And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.</p>
      <p>{28:41} And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.</p>
      <p>{28:42} And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:</p>
      <p>{28:43} And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy [place;] that they bear not iniquity, and die: [it shall be] a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.</p>
      <h4>Exodus 29</h4>
      <p>{29:1} And this [is] the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,</p>
      <p>{29:2} And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: [of] wheaten flour shalt thou make them.</p>
      <p>{29:3} And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.</p>
      <p>{29:4} And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.</p>
      <p>{29:5} And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:</p>
      <p>{29:6} And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.</p>
      <p>{29:7} Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour [it] upon his head, and anoint him.</p>
      <p>{29:8} And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.</p>
      <p>{29:9} And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.</p>
      <p>{29:10} And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.</p>
      <p>{29:11} And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, [by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
      <p>{29:12} And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.</p>
      <p>{29:13} And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul [that is] above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn [them] upon the altar.</p>
      <p>{29:14} But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it [is] a sin offering.</p>
      <p>{29:15} Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
