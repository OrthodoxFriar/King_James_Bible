      <h4>Exodus 38</h4>
      <p>{38:1} And he made the altar of burnt offering [of] shittim wood: five cubits [was] the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; [it was] foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.</p>
      <p>{38:2} And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.</p>

      <p>{38:22} And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
      <p>{38:23} And with him [was] Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.</p>
      <p>{38:24} All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy [place,] even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</p>
      <p>{38:25} And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation [was] an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:</p>
      <p>{38:26} A bekah for every man, [that is,] half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty [men. ]</p>
      <p>{38:27} And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.</p>

      <p>{39:6} And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.</p>
