===============================================
Authorized Version of the King James Bible 1611
===============================================


Downloaded the text version from **The Internet Archive**. 
This version is placed in the public domain and the formatting should lend itself to search and replace functions rather than hand editing the entire Bible.

`wget https://archive.org/stream/TheHolyBiblekjv1611Wapocrypha/1611KjvW_apocrypha_djvu.txt`

Cloned the repository to local drive
cd to the directory where I want the repo to live
`git clone git@github.com:OrthodoxFriar/King_James_Bible.git`
